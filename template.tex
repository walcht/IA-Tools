\abstract{This paper presents an overview of the latest state-of-the-art
platforms and tools which can be used to develop immersive analytics
(hereafter IA) applications. The term platform refers to programs that provide
a high-level application programming interface (API) along side a set
of extensive XR features which allow developers to create complex XR
experiences. Initially, an overview of what we believe are the major extended
reality (hereafter XR) development platforms is provided after which a table
of, what we think are, important-to-have features and by which platforms they
are supported is presented.

\firstsection{Introduction}
\maketitle
This template is for papers of VGTC-sponsored conferences which are
\emph{\textbf{not}} published in a special issue of TVCG.

\section{Platforms}
\subsection{Unity}
Unity has a wide adoption in the world of XR thanks to its unified workflow
and support for various XR platforms - build once, run
everywhere -. Unity supports an extensive set of XR vendor-specific software
development kits (hereafter SDK) including: Apple's ARKit, Google's ARCore,
Microsoft's HoloLens and OpenXR. Following the announcement of Apple's
mixed reality (MR) headset Vision Pro in Apple's Worldwide Developers
Conference (WWDC) 2023, Unity was announced to provide native support for
Vision's Pro operating system VisionOS \cite{web:vision_pro_unity}.
Unity also provides a set of XR packages that are built on top of these vendor
plugins to add application-level development tools \cite{unity:xr_packages}.
For instance, AR Foundation is an industry-standard framework that provides
support for various AR features such as: object tracking and plane detection.
\subsection{Unreal Engine}
\subsection{Comparison}
Figure \ref{table:1} provides a comparison between the previously discussed
platforms in terms of support for vendor-specific SDKs and a set of features.

\section{Toolkits}
\subsection{DXR Toolkit}
Mr. X and al. proposed an IA toolkit built on top of the Unity game engine.
DXR allows fast prototyping and iteration for non-experienced users; i.e.
users with no or little programming knowledge in XR and Unity.
Alongside the data input, DXR takes a specification file written in JavaScript
Object Notation (hereafter JSON) from which visualisations are created.
The specification file is described in Vega-Like declarative grammar
(only what should be achieved has to be provided, not how) making it suitable
for users with no programming experience to rapidly realise immersive
visualisations. This file can be edited in a separate text editor or through
the use of a GUI with pre-configured set of parameters. DXR also provides
built-in specification templates for common visualisations such as: Scatter
plots and bar charts. This even more extends the scope of users to include
those without any technical experience. Although the authors claim that DXR
provides suitable flexibility, the scope of that flexibility seems to be
limited, among other things, to providing custom graphical markers, custom
encoding channels (a channel is a visualisation parameter affected by some
data attribute, such as object size affected a quantitative value in data)
and other visualisation-type specific properties. That limits users to a
templated and common set of visualisations such as Scatter plots, bar charts
and radial bars. There is also no mention of real-time data support thus
limiting the use-case of DXR to offline data only. As the authors have
explicitly mentioned, DXR is meant for prototyping and exploring designs, it
is not designed to handle visualisations of large data-sets. On HoloLens,
for datasets with more than approximatly a 1000 item, sub-optimal; i.e. less
that 60 frames per second (hereafter FPS) performance has been observed.
Nonetheless, the author argue that DXR can still be useful for quickly and
cheaply prototyping large dataset designs before moving to specialized,
optimized and detailed implementations.
